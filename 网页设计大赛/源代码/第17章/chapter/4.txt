That¡¯s why you go away
Baby won't you tell me why there is sadness in your eyes 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget 
but there is something left in my head 
You're the one who set it up now you're the one to make it stop 
I'm the one who's feeling lost right now 
Now you want me to forget every little thing you said 
but there is something left in my head 
Chorus: 
I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long 
But I'm not the man your heart is missing 
That's why you go away I know 
You were never satisfied no matter how I tried 
Now you wanna say goodbye to me 
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget 
but there is something left in my head
Chorus: 
I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feeling's so strong... 
Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere 
Don't know which way to go 
There aren¡¯t so much to say now between us 
There aren¡¯t so much for you 
There aren¡¯t so much for me anymore 
Chorus 
I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feeling's so strong...
