    Big Big World
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I too too will miss you much
miss you much...
I can see the first leaf falling
it's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
like the way I'm feeling inside
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I too too will miss you much
miss you much...
Outside it's now raining
and tears are falling from my eyes
why did it have to happen
why did it all have to end
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I too too will miss you much
miss you much...
I have your arms around me ooooh like fire
but when I open my eyes
you're gone...
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I too too will miss you much
miss you much...
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do feel I will miss you much
miss you much...
大大的世界
我是一个大大方方的女孩
在这个大大的世界
那并不是一件非常大不了的事情，如果你离开我
但我确实会感到
我也很想你，非常想你
我能看到第一片落叶
尽管已经变黄，却很美丽
外面非常寒冷
犹如我内心的感觉
我是一个大大方方的女孩
在这个大大的世界
那并不是一件非常大不了的事情，如果你离开我
但我确实会感到
我也很想你，非常想你
外面正下着雨
眼泪却夺眶而出
为什么会发生
又为什么会结束
我是一个大大方方的女孩
在这个大大的世界
那并不是一件非常大不了的事情，如果你离开我
但我确实会感到
我也很想你，非常想你
我希望你象火焰一样拥抱我，
可是当我睁开眼睛，你已远去
我是一个大大方方的女孩
在这个大大的世界
那并不是一件非常大不了的事情，如果你离开我
但我确实会感到
我也很想你，非常想你
我是一个大大方方的女孩
在这个大大的世界
那并不是一件非常大不了的事情，如果你离开我
但我确实会感到
我也很想你，非常想你
  Casablanca卡萨布兰卡 
I fell in love with u watching Casablanca.
back row at the driving show in the flickering light.
pop-corn cokes beneath the stars.
became champagnen. caviarn 
makeing love on the long hot summer's night.
I thought u fell in love with me watching Casablanca.
holding hands beneath the paddle fans.
in rick's candle-lit cafe.
hiding in the shadows from the spots.
in rocky moonlight in u arms.
Making magic in the movie in my old chevroletn.(美国)雪佛兰牌汽车;.
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
A kiss is not a kiss without u sigh.
Please come back 2 us in Casablanca.
I love u more each day as time goes by.
I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca.
U know I’ve never really been there.
So I don't know.
I guess our love story will never be seen.
On the big wide silver screen.
But it hurt just as badly when I had 2-watch u go.
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
A kiss is not a kiss without Ur sigh.
Please come back 2 us in Casablanca.
I love u more each day as time goes by.
Everything I do
 (I do it for you)

Look into my eyes - you will see
what you mean to me
search your heart - search your soul
and when you find me there you'll search no more
don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
you know it's true
everything if do - I do it for you
look into my heart - you will find
there's nothin' there to hide
take me as I am - take my life
I would give it all - I would sacrifice
don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it - there's nothing' I want more
ya know it's true
everything I do - I do it for you
there's no love - like your 
love
and no other - could give more love
there's nowhere - unless you're there
all the time - all the way
oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it - there's nothing' I want more
I would fight for you - I’d lie for you
walk the wire for you - ya I’d die for you
ya know it's true

Love me tender
Love me tender, love me sweet
never let me go
you have made my life complete
and I love you so
love me tender, love me true
all my dreams fulfilled
for my darling, I love you
and I always will
love me tender, love me long
take me to your heart
for it's there that I belong
and we'll never part
love me tender, love me dear
tell me your are mine
I’ll be yours through all the year
till the end of time
