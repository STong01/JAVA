Love me tender
Love me tender, love me sweet
never let me go
you have made my life complete
and I love you so
love me tender, love me true
all my dreams fulfilled
for my darling, I love you
and I always will
love me tender, love me long
take me to your heart
for it's there that I belong
and we'll never part
love me tender, love me dear
tell me your are mine
I¡¯ll be yours through all the year
till the end of time
end
