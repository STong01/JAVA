		Casablanca
I fell in love with u watching Casablanca.
back row at the driving show in the flickering light.
pop-corn cokes beneath the stars.
became champagnen. caviarn 
makeing love on the long hot summer's night.
I thought u fell in love with me watching Casablanca.
holding hands beneath the paddle fans.
in rick's candle-lit cafe.
hiding in the shadows from the spots.
in rocky moonlight in u arms.
Making magic in the movie in my old chevroletn.(ÃÀ¹ú)Ñ©·ðÀ¼ÅÆÆû³µ;.
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
A kiss is not a kiss without u sigh.
Please come back 2 us in Casablanca.
I love u more each day as time goes by.
I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca.
U know I¡¯ve never really been there.
So I don't know.
I guess our love story will never be seen.
On the big wide silver screen.
But it hurt just as badly when I had 2-watch u go.
Oh a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
A kiss is not a kiss without Ur sigh.
Please come back 2 us in Casablanca.
I love u more each day as time goes by.
