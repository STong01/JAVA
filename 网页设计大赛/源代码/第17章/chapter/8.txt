Oh oh yeah yeah
I love you more than I can say
I love you twice as much tomorrow
I love you more than I can say
Oh oh yeah yeah
I¡¯ll miss you every single day
Why must my life be filled with sorrow?
I love you more than I can say
Don¡¯t you know I need you so
Tell me please I glottal know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy
Oh oh yeah yeah
I miss you more that I can say
Why must my life be filled with sorrow
